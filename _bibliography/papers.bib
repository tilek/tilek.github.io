  abstract  = "Access to safely managed drinking water (SMDW) remains a global
               challenge, and affects 2.2 billion people1,2. Solar-driven
               atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) devices with continuous
               cycling may accelerate progress by enabling decentralized
               extraction of water from air3-6, but low specific yields (SY)
               and low daytime relative humidity (RH) have raised questions
               about their performance (in litres of water output per day)7-11.
               However, to our knowledge, no analysis has mapped the global
               potential of AWH12 despite favourable conditions in tropical
               regions, where two-thirds of people without SMDW live2. Here we
               show that AWH could provide SMDW for a billion people. Our
               assessment-using Google Earth Engine13-introduces a hypothetical
               1-metre-square device with a SY profile of 0.2 to 2.5 litres per
               kilowatt-hour (0.1 to 1.25 litres per kilowatt-hour for a
               2-metre-square device) at 30\% to 90\% RH, respectively. Such a
               device could meet a target average daily drinking water
               requirement of 5 litres per day per person14. We plot the impact
               potential of existing devices and new sorbent classes, which
               suggests that these targets could be met with continued
               technological development, and well within thermodynamic limits.
               Indeed, these performance targets have been achieved
               experimentally in demonstrations of sorbent materials15-17. Our
               tools can inform design trade-offs for atmospheric water
               harvesting devices that maximize global impact, alongside
               ongoing efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
               with existing technologies.",
